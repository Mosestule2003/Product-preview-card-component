### What I learned

During the course of this project, I was able to understand more how css grid worked and also how to structure a HTML document in a more concise manner. Although I came across a number of issues when trying to workout the media queries, but ended up solving it.


### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_align.asp) - This helped me understand the dynamic nature of the css horizontal and vertical layout and how to efffectively use it in a in varring situations. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- (https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_responsive.asp) - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand how to add responsiveness to my project. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
